Hypatia
=======

Overview
--------
Hypatia is the world's first FOSS malware scanner for Android. It is powered by ClamAV style signature databases.

Features
--------
- Near zero battery impact: you'll never notice any impact on battery at all
- Extremely fast: it can scan small files (1MB) in <20ms, and even large files (40MB) in 1000ms.
- Memory efficient: with the default databases enabled it uses under 120MB.
- Regular scan: allowing selection of /system, internal storage, external storage, and installed apps
- Realtime scanner: can detect malware in realtime on write/rename in internal storage
- Completely offline: Internet is only used to download signature databases, files will never ever leave your device
- Persistence: will automatically restart on boot/update
- Tiny codebase: coming in at under 1000 sloc, it can be audited by even someone with basic programming experience
- Minimal dependencies: the app only uses libraries when necessary
- Signature databases can be enabled/disabled at the users demand


Troubleshooting
------------------
- **The app crashes and is very buggy:**
The first thing to check is if you have extended databases enabled. Extended databases require more RAM (8 GB), and can occasionally cause the app to be very buggy.
- **Unable to download databases:**
If this occurs, try tapping the ellipsis in the top right of the main screen and tap `Database server override`. This uses a mirror database in case the main database is down.
- **There are false positives:**
This occasionally occurs due to the nature of bloom filters. If you believe there is a false positive, first, rescan. This will sometimes fix the false positive. And if this still returns a false positive, scan the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload), and this will tell you if you truly have a false positive or rather some malware.

Signature Databases
-------------------
We currently have 2 working signature database server provider. Both Signing keys are `5298C0C0C3E73288`

- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/MaintainTeam/HypatiaDatabases/)
  - to use in app & see generation reports: https://maintainteam.codeberg.page/HypatiaDatabases/
- [GitHub](https://github.com/MaintainTeam/HypatiaDatabases/)
  - to use in app & see generation reports: https://maintainteam.github.io/HypatiaDatabases/

Database updates occurs in per 2 day about at 01 AM - 03 AM in both provider to `unsigned` branch. Then signing process made by self-hosted CI and push to `gh-pages`/`pages` branch about 06 AM. Each provider will generate static web-server from these branches. (UTC)

APK Info & Security
--------------------

Both debug, release and nightly versions built by GitHub Actions. You can check checksum notice in Release Actions or/and checksum.txt in releases to compare with Application's

This is the SHA fingerprint of Hypatia's signing key to verify downloaded APKs which are signed by us.

Technical Details
------------------
- Signature databases are serialized Guava BloomFilter object format
- Signature databases will not be redownloaded if the file hasn't changed on the server (304 not modified)
- Signatures are stored using BloomFilters for O(k) lookup
- Files have their MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes calculated in one pass
- Realtime scanner is multithreaded and will use half of the device's core count for scanning multiple files asynchronously
- Realtime scanning powered by a recursive FileObserver

Permissions
-----------------
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE`: Used for realtime scanning.
- `INTERNET`: Download and update databases.
- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Used for reading malicous files for scanning, and deleting infected files.
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`: Used for scanning malicous apps.
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Scanning external storage.
- `RECIEVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`: Restart the app on reboot.
- `REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES`: Used for removing infected apps.
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: Notifications.
- `WAKE_LOCK`
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Used for removing infected files.
- `ACCESIBILITY_SERVICE`: Used to allow the link scanner to read the screen and check for malicious domains.
- `DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION`

Planned Updates
----------------
- Option to scan on access
- Scan newly installed/updated apps
- Option to let 3rd-party apps invoke scans
- Automatic database updates
- Database sanity checks
- Testing
- Better GUI
- Translations
- Scanning entire system using root (low priority)

Goals
-----
- Be fast
- Don't eat batteries
- Use minimal permissions
- Use libraries only when necessary
