Hypatia
=======

Overview
--------
Hypatia is the world's first FOSS malware scanner for Android. It is powered by ClamAV style signature databases.

Features
--------
- Near zero battery impact: you'll never notice any impact on battery at all
- Extremely fast: it can scan small files (1MB) in <20ms, and even large files (40MB) in 1000ms.
- Memory efficient: with the default databases enabled it uses under 120MB.
- Regular scan: allowing selection of /system, internal storage, external storage, and installed apps
- Realtime scanner: can detect malware in realtime on write/rename in internal storage
- Completely offline: Internet is only used to download signature databases, files will never ever leave your device
- Persistence: will automatically restart on boot/update
- Tiny codebase: coming in at under 1000 sloc, it can be audited by even someone with basic programming experience
- Minimal dependencies: the app only uses libraries when necessary
- Signature databases can be enabled/disabled at the users demand

Signature Databases
-------------------
We currently have 2 working signature database server provider. Both Signing keys are `5298C0C0C3E73288`
> [!WARNING]
> Codeberg sometimes return 500 (see https://github.com/MaintainTeam/Hypatia/issues/11#issuecomment-2693793420)
- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/MaintainTeam/HypatiaDatabases/)
  - to use in app & see generation reports: https://maintainteam.codeberg.page/HypatiaDatabases/
- [GitHub](https://github.com/MaintainTeam/HypatiaDatabases/)
  - to use in app & see generation reports: https://maintainteam.github.io/HypatiaDatabases/

Database updates occurs in per 2 day about at 01 AM - 03 AM in both provider to `unsigned` branch. Then signing process made by self-hosted CI and push to `gh-pages`/`pages` branch about 06 AM. Each provider will generate static web-server from these branches. (UTC)

Technical Details
------------------
- Signature databases are serialized Guava BloomFilter object format
- Signature databases will not be redownloaded if the file hasn't changed on the server (304 not modified)
- Signatures are stored using BloomFilters for O(k) lookup
- Files have their MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes calculated in one pass
- Realtime scanner is multithreaded and will use half of the device's core count for scanning multiple files asynchronously
- Realtime scanning powered by a recursive FileObserver

Planned Updates
----------------
- Option to scan on access
- Scan newly installed/updated apps
- Option to let 3rd-party apps invoke scans
- Automatic database updates
- Database sanity checks
- Testing
- Better GUI
- Translations
- Scanning entire system using root (low priority)

Goals
-----
- Be fast
- Don't eat batteries
- Use minimal permissions
- Use libraries only when necessary
